# Real-Time Chat Application

## Overview
This is a real-time chat application built using **Laravel**, **Pusher** (or **Reverb**), and **Laravel Echo**. The application allows users to send and receive messages instantly, creating a seamless communication experience. It includes both private and global chat features, enabling users to communicate individually or in groups.

## Features
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages instantly using WebSockets.
- **Private Chats:** Send messages to individual users in a private channel.
- **Global Chat:** A public channel where users can chat with everyone in the system.
- **User Authentication:** Each user has an account, and messages are sent and received based on authentication.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend:** Laravel Echo, Pusher or Reverb
- **Authentication:** Laravel Breeze
- **Database:** MySQL
- **WebSockets:** Pusher or Reverb for real-time messaging
- **Queue System:** Redis (optional for queue jobs)

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
- PHP 8.x or higher
- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- Redis (if using queue jobs)
- Laravel Echo Server (for broadcasting events if not using Pusher)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/realtime-chat-app.git
cd realtime-chat-app
```

### Step 2: Install PHP Dependencies
Install the PHP dependencies via Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

### Step 3: Install Node.js Dependencies
Install Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with the necessary configuration:
- Set `APP_KEY`, `APP_NAME`, `APP_URL`, `DB_*` to match your local environment.
- Configure your **Pusher** or **Reverb** settings. If you're using Pusher, the variables should be set as follows:

```env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
PUSHER_APP_ID=your-pusher-app-id
PUSHER_APP_KEY=your-pusher-app-key
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=your-pusher-app-secret
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=your-pusher-app-cluster
```

If you're using **Reverb** for broadcasting, set the `BROADCAST_DRIVER` to `reverb` and configure the `REVERB_*` settings accordingly.

For Redis (if you are using Redis for queues):

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

### Step 5: Generate Application Key
Run the following command to generate your Laravel application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Step 6: Migrate the Database
Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 7: Set Up Redis (Optional)
If you're using Redis for queue jobs, ensure Redis is installed and running on your local machine. You can install Redis using the following commands based on your OS:

#### For Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

#### For Mac (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install redis
```

Start the Redis server:

```bash
redis-server
```

Alternatively, if you're using **Docker** for Redis, run:

```bash
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

### Step 8: Set Up Broadcasting
If you're using **Pusher**:
Make sure you've added the **Pusher** configuration to your `.env` file as explained above.

If you're using **Reverb**, make sure to configure the `broadcasting.php` configuration file with the correct Reverb setup. 

### Step 9: Start Laravel Echo Server (For Pusher or Reverb)
If you're using **Pusher**, you don't need to start an Echo server. Pusher will handle the WebSocket connection for you.

However, if you're using **Reverb** (or have your own Echo server setup), you need to start the Laravel Echo Server. Install the Echo server globally:

```bash
npm install -g laravel-echo-server
```

Then start the Echo server:

```bash
laravel-echo-server start
```

### Step 10: Run the Development Server
Now, you can start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Additionally, run the frontend asset compiler:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 11: Queue Jobs (Optional)
If your application uses Redis for queue jobs (e.g., sending notifications), you need to run the queue worker:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

If you want the queue to process jobs in the background, you can use `supervisor` (or a similar tool) to keep it running.

## Usage

1. **Register or log in** to the system.
2. **Start chatting** in the global chat or send private messages to other users.
3. Enjoy **real-time communication** with your users!

## Troubleshooting

- **Pusher not working:** Make sure you have the correct Pusher keys in your `.env` file and that your app is connected to the right Pusher cluster.
- **Redis issues:** Ensure Redis is running and properly configured in your `.env` file.
- **Echo server not starting:** Check that all required dependencies for Laravel Echo Server are installed, and verify your `.env` settings.
